hello world !!
the last check point without any breakdown for every aspiring ,dreamy coding warriors...
along this perilous journey there is times when by some unknown miracles, the script flows as it should and works fine but whenever we try optimize it, it fell apart.
so at times like this questions start popping up:

- why it doesn't work when it should ? 
- how can i know if my code is performing well or whats the definite criteria to compare with other ones ?

well i know that this questions have solutions and response to them but at my current level numbers aren't sufficient for me and even after understanding the implications and meanings behind them, i guess many confrere like me  find it hard to link numbers with performance and efficiency or like how to adjust that criterias or number to the actual use cases.

for now before going any deeper it appears to me that , i need to discover and accomodate the existing ways to compare beyond number as to know how to navigate this vaste ocean 
and understand the real because .

thats represent the biginning of a new journey for me and you courageous reader !!
